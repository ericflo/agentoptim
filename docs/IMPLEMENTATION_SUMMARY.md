# Verbalized Confidence Score Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of verbalized confidence score elicitation and visualization in AgentOptim v2.2.0.

## Background

LLMs can provide judgments about conversational quality, but understanding how certain the model is in those judgments adds a crucial dimension to evaluation. By eliciting and visualizing confidence scores, we can:

1. Identify where models are uncertain in their judgments
2. Measure how well-calibrated different models are
3. Compare confidence patterns across models and evaluation scenarios
4. Detect areas where models might be overconfident or underconfident

## Implementation Summary

We've completed all 5 phases of the confidence score implementation roadmap:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation ✅ 

- Created `confidence.py` module with the base infrastructure
- Designed `PromptMethod` base class for different elicitation methods 
- Implemented robust regex pattern matching for confidence extraction
- Added confidence score normalization functions
- Designed response classification system (valid/invalid/no_answer)

### Phase 2: Elicitation Methods ✅

- Implemented 7 different confidence elicitation methods:
  - `basic_percentage`: Simple percentage format (0-100%)
  - `basic_float`: Simple float format (0.0-1.0)
  - `basic_letter`: Letter grades for confidence (A-E)
  - `basic_text`: Text descriptions of confidence (very low to very high)
  - `advanced_probability`: Probability with explanation (0.0-1.0)
  - `combo_exemplars`: Few-shot examples with confidence (0.0-1.0) - **RECOMMENDED**
  - `multi_guess`: Multiple judgments with probabilities

### Phase 3: Integration & Evaluation ✅

- Added confidence elicitation configuration to EvalSet schema
- Integrated confidence scores into evaluation results 
- Implemented Expected Calibration Error (ECE) calculation
- Created calibration curve calculation utility
- Designed confidence distribution analysis tools
- Added confidence diversity metrics (distinct values, variance)

### Phase 4: Visualization & Reporting ✅

- Added confidence visualization to CLI output
- Implemented calibration curve plotting with matplotlib
- Created confidence distribution histogram generation
- Added confidence metrics to evaluation reports
- Added support for confidence data in export formats (CSV, JSON, HTML, Markdown)
- Designed calibration comparison view for multiple models

### Phase 5: Documentation & Examples ✅

- Created `CONFIDENCE_ELICITATION.md` with API documentation
- Created `CONFIDENCE_VISUALIZATION.md` with visualization guide
- Added a comprehensive example script (`confidence_visualization.py`)
- Documented best practices for confidence score elicitation
- Updated API reference with confidence-related features

## Features Implemented

### Confidence Elicitation

- 7 different elicitation methods based on research
- Customizable instructions for each method
- Flexible regex pattern matching for different response formats
- Fallback default values for failed extractions
- Normalized confidence scores (0.0-1.0 range)
- Comprehensive documentation of method effectiveness
- Default `combo_exemplars` method based on research findings

### Confidence Visualization

- CLI visualization command: `agentoptim run visualize`
- Multiple visualization types:
  - `histogram`: Distribution of confidence scores
  - `calibration`: Calibration curves showing predicted vs. actual
  - `distribution`: Table of questions with corresponding confidences
  - `summary`: Text summary of all confidence metrics
- Multiple output formats:
  - ASCII/Unicode art for terminal display
  - PNG image export via matplotlib
  - CSV, JSON, HTML, Markdown export for data analysis
- Model comparison functionality
- Color-coded terminal output

### Integration

- Confidence scores stored in evaluation results
- Summary statistics on mean confidence
- Separate stats for "Yes" and "No" judgments
- Calibration metrics in evaluation summaries
- Export functions for all data formats

## CLI Usage

The most visible part of the implementation is the new CLI visualization command:

```bash
# Basic summary of confidence metrics
agentoptim run visualize <eval_run_id> --type summary

# Generate a histogram (with optional colorization)
agentoptim run visualize <eval_run_id> --type histogram --color

# Create a calibration curve and save as image
agentoptim run visualize <eval_run_id> --type calibration --save-image calibration.png

# View confidence distribution by question with color coding
agentoptim run visualize <eval_run_id> --type distribution --color

# Compare calibration between two evaluation runs
agentoptim run visualize <eval_run_id> --type calibration --compare <another_eval_run_id>
```

## Research Foundation

The implementation is based on research papers including:

- Lin et al. (2023), "Practically Calibrated Uncertainty in Large Language Models"
- Zhou et al. (2023), "SCOTT: Self-Consistent Chain-of-Thought Distillation"
- Mielke et al. (2022), "Reducing Overconfidence in Large Language Models"

## Conclusion

The confidence elicitation and visualization system provides a comprehensive set of tools for understanding model uncertainty in evaluation judgments. The implementation includes multiple elicitation methods, powerful visualization capabilities, and thorough documentation.

This feature elevates AgentOptim from a simple evaluation tool to a sophisticated analysis platform for AI conversation quality, enabling deeper understanding of model behavior and decision-making.

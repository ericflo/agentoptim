# AgentOptim v2.2.0 Release Notes - September 2025

We're excited to announce the release of AgentOptim v2.2.0, featuring a revolutionary new system message optimization tool that automatically generates, evaluates, and ranks system messages for optimal performance.

## What's New in v2.2.0

### ðŸ§  System Message Optimization

- **New MCP Tool**: `optimize_system_messages_tool` for comprehensive system message optimization
- **Automated Generation**: Creates diverse candidate system messages tailored to user queries
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Tests each candidate against real user messages using existing EvalSet infrastructure
- **Detailed Ranking**: Provides per-criterion performance breakdown for informed selection
- **Self-Optimization**: Meta-prompt system that improves itself over time based on performance feedback

### ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with the existing MCP ecosystem
- **CLI Commands**: New `agentoptim optimize` commands for system message optimization from the command line
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient evaluation of multiple system message candidates
- **Rich Visualization**: Interactive progress display with detailed comparisons
- **Persistent Storage**: Save and retrieve optimization results for future reference

### ðŸ’¯ Optimization Features

- **Domain Specialization**: Optimize system messages for specific domains (customer support, coding, etc.)
- **Starting Points**: Provide existing system messages as starting points for further optimization
- **Export Options**: Export results in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- **Interactive Wizard**: Guided optimization process with step-by-step wizard
- **Versioned Tracking**: Performance history across generator versions

## Technical Implementation

The system message optimization tool consists of several coordinated components:

1. **Generator System**: Creates diverse candidate system messages using a meta-prompt
2. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Tests candidates against real user messages using existing EvalSets
3. **Ranking Algorithm**: Scores candidates based on multiple criteria with detailed breakdowns
4. **Self-Optimization Loop**: Improves the meta-prompt based on performance feedback
5. **Storage System**: Persists optimization runs and generator versions

## Getting Started

To start using the system message optimization tool:

```python
from agentoptim import optimize_system_messages_tool

# Basic usage
result = await optimize_system_messages_tool(
    action="optimize",
    user_query="How do I reset my password?",
    num_candidates=5,
    evalset_id="customer-support-quality"
)

# Get the best system message
best_system_message = result["candidates"][0]["system_message"]

# See detailed performance breakdown
performance = result["candidates"][0]["performance"]
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
# Generate and evaluate system messages
agentoptim optimize create --query "How do I reset my password?" --evalset customer-support-quality

# List past optimization runs
agentoptim optimize list

# Get detailed results from a specific run
agentoptim optimize get <run_id>
```

## Feedback and Support

We're excited to hear how you're using the new system message optimization features! Please share your feedback and questions through our GitHub issues.

## What's Next

We're continuing to improve AgentOptim with a focus on:

- Multi-modal evaluation capabilities
- Advanced customization for specialized domains
- Integration with more ML platforms and frameworks
- Expanded documentation and tutorials

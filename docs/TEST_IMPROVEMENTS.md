# Test Improvement Plan for AgentOptim v2.1.0

This document outlines areas for test improvement in the AgentOptim codebase for the upcoming v2.1.0 release.

## Current Test Coverage

As of v2.0.0, the overall test coverage is 91%, with the following breakdown by module:

- __init__.py: 100% (Package initialization)
- cache.py: 100% (Caching functionality)
- errors.py: 100% (Error handling)
- validation.py: 99% (Input validation)
- utils.py: 95% (Utility functions)
- compat.py: 86% (Compatibility layer - to be removed in v2.1.0)
- evalset.py: 88% (EvalSet management)
- runner.py: 74% (Evaluation execution)
- server.py: 66% (MCP server endpoints)

## Priority Areas for Improvement

### 1. Server Module (Current: 66%)

The server.py module is critical as it provides the MCP tool endpoints that users directly interact with. Currently, we have basic tests that mock the underlying implementation, but we need more comprehensive tests to ensure error handling, validation, and edge cases are properly covered.

Suggested additions:

1. **Test input validation in tool functions**:
   - Test handling of missing required parameters
   - Test handling of invalid parameter types
   - Test handling of invalid parameter values
   - Test error formatting and response structure

2. **Test detailed functionality of manage_evalset_tool**:
   - Test each action (create, get, list, update, delete) individually
   - Test error cases for each action
   - Test with various parameter combinations

3. **Test detailed functionality of run_evalset_tool**:
   - Test with different conversation formats
   - Test with different model parameters
   - Test error handling for invalid evalset_id
   - Test error handling for invalid conversation format
   - Test parallel execution configurability

4. **Add integration tests**:
   - Test the server with actual MCP transport
   - Test end-to-end functionality with real evalsets
   - Test handling of concurrent requests

### 2. Runner Module (Current: 74%)

The runner.py module handles the evaluation execution, which is a core part of the functionality.

Suggested additions:

1. **Test model interaction**:
   - Test with different model providers
   - Test timeout handling
   - Test rate limit handling
   - Test error handling for model API failures

2. **Test parallel processing**:
   - Test with various max_parallel settings
   - Test handling of failures in parallel execution
   - Test performance with large question sets

3. **Test result processing**:
   - Test summary generation with various scenarios
   - Test handling of partial failures
   - Test result formatting

### 3. EvalSet Module (Current: 88%)

The evalset.py module has good coverage, but we can improve it further:

1. **Test template validation**:
   - Test with various template formats
   - Test with invalid templates
   - Test with missing required variables

2. **Test storage operations**:
   - Test concurrent access scenarios
   - Test handling of corrupted storage files
   - Test handling of file system errors

### 4. Integration Testing

While we have some integration tests, we should expand them to cover:

1. **End-to-end workflows**:
   - Test creating an evalset and then running it
   - Test updating an evalset and verifying changes affect evaluation
   - Test multiple concurrent evaluations

2. **Error recovery**:
   - Test handling of temporary failures
   - Test resuming evaluations after interruptions

## Implementation Plan

For the v2.1.0 release, we should:

1. Create a dedicated test improvement sprint
2. Focus first on server.py to improve coverage to at least 85%
3. Add additional runner.py tests to reach at least 85%
4. Enhance integration tests for end-to-end validation
5. Verify compatibility with different model providers
6. Run benchmarks to ensure performance meets expectations

## Tools and Approaches

1. Use parameterized tests to efficiently test multiple scenarios
2. Add mock responses for model API calls to test error handling
3. Use test fixtures to set up test environments
4. Consider property-based testing for complex validation logic
5. Implement test timing to identify slow tests

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these test improvements:

1. Overall test coverage should increase to 95%+
2. Server module coverage should increase to 85%+
3. Runner module coverage should increase to 85%+
4. Integration test coverage should be significantly enhanced

These improvements will ensure the codebase is robust and reliable as we remove the compatibility layer and focus exclusively on the 2-tool architecture in v2.1.0.

Example of using AgentOptim to benchmark conversation quality across a standard dataset.

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Create a standardized conversation benchmark dataset
2. Evaluate conversations using consistent evaluation criteria
3. Generate benchmark scores and metrics
4. Track performance over time against baseline standards

Use case: Building conversation quality benchmarks for monitoring and improvement

Add salt to the boiling water (about 1-2 tablespoons)\n3. Add pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions (usually 8-12 minutes)\n4. While pasta cooks, prepare a simple sauce:\n   - For a quick tomato sauce: Heat olive oil in a pan, add minced garlic, then add canned crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and herbs like basil or oregano\n   - For a simple garlic and oil sauce: Saut√© minced garlic in olive oil until fragrant, add red pepper flakes if desired\n5. Drain the pasta when it's al dente (firm to the bite)\n6. Combine the pasta with your sauce in the pan and toss to coat\n7. Serve immediately, optionally topped with grated cheese like Parmesan\n\nThis basic method can be customized with different ingredients like vegetables, meat, or different sauce bases according to your preference.",
    
    "complex-explanation-1": "Quantum computing, in simple terms, is a type of computing that uses the strange properties of quantum physics to process information in ways that traditional computers cannot.\n\nHere's the basic idea:\n\n1. Traditional computers use bits (0s and 1s) as their basic unit of information\n2. Quantum computers use quantum bits or \"qubits\"\n3. While regular bits can only be 0 OR 1 at any time, qubits can exist in a state called \"superposition\" where they are essentially 0 AND 1 simultaneously\n4. Qubits can also be \"entangled\" with each other, meaning the state of one instantly affects the other, no matter the distance between them\n\nThese properties allow quantum computers to consider many possibilities simultaneously and potentially solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers. For example, they might eventually excel at:\n- Breaking certain types of encryption\n- Simulating molecules for drug discovery\n- Optimizing complex systems like traffic flow or supply chains\n\nHowever, quantum computers are still in early stages of development, extremely difficult to build and maintain (requiring near absolute zero temperatures), and are not replacements for everyday computing tasks.",

Authenticity: Some may feel AI art lacks the human experience that gives art meaning\n4. Market clarity: Disclosure helps maintain clear distinctions in the art market\n\nArguments against mandatory disclosure:\n1. Tools perspective: AI can be viewed as simply another tool artists use, like Photoshop\n2. Creative direction: Humans still direct the AI, making creative choices and refinements\n3. Result focus: The final artwork might be judged on its own merits regardless of creation method\n4. Evolving standards: Art has always incorporated new technologies without special labeling\n\nEmerging best practices:\n- Many platforms and marketplaces are beginning to require disclosure of AI usage\n- Some artists voluntarily disclose AI usage as part of their creative process\n- Industry standards are still developing\n\nThe most ethical approach would likely include some form of disclosure when AI plays a substantial role in creating commercial artwork, especially if customers might reasonably assume it was created entirely by human hands.

## Summary

This benchmark evaluates conversation quality across {len(benchmark_conversations)} standardized test cases 
spanning {len(category_scores)} categories and {len(difficulty_scores)} difficulty levels.

## Benchmark Criteria

Conversations were evaluated using two EvalSets:

1. **General Conversation Quality**: Measures helpfulness, clarity, accuracy, and appropriateness
2. **Complex Reasoning Quality**: Assesses logical reasoning, depth, and balanced analysis

## Key Findings

1. The gold standard responses achieved an average score of {overall_scores.get("gold", 0):.1f}%
2. There is a clear performance gradient between quality levels (excellent ‚Üí good ‚Üí average ‚Üí poor)
3. The highest performing category was {max(category_scores.items(), key=lambda x: sum(x[1])/len(x[1]))[0]}
4. The most challenging category was {min(category_scores.items(), key=lambda x: sum(x[1])/len(x[1]))[0]}

## Recommendations

Based on benchmark results, focus improvement efforts on:

1. Developing more robust handling of {min(category_scores.items(), key=lambda x: sum(x[1])/len(x[1]))[0]} queries
2. Increasing complexity handling for {max(difficulty_scores.items(), key=lambda x: sum(x[1])/len(x[1]))[0]} difficulty questions
3. Addressing specific weaknesses identified in average and poor response patterns

## Using This Benchmark

This benchmark provides standardized metrics for:
- Tracking quality improvements over time
- Comparing different models or prompting strategies
- Identifying specific strengths and weaknesses

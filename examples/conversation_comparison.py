"""
Example of using AgentOptim to compare different conversation approaches.

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Create an EvalSet focused on conversational style/tone
2. Define multiple conversation approaches for the same user query
3. Compare the effectiveness of different response styles
4. Analyze the results to identify the most effective approach

Use case: Comparing formal vs. casual vs. technical response styles

Select the appropriate protocol from the available options:\n   - OpenVPN (UDP/TCP): Most secure, uses ports 1194/443\n   - IKEv2/IPSec: Good for mobile connections, automatic reconnection\n   - WireGuard: Modern protocol with enhanced performance\n   - L2TP/IPSec: Legacy protocol with PSK or certificate authentication\n\n4. Input the server parameters:\n   - Server hostname/IP (e.g., vpn.domain.tld or 203.0.113.1)\n   - Authentication credentials: username/password or certificate\n   - Encryption parameters: cipher suite, key length, hashing algorithm\n   - Split tunneling configuration (if applicable)\n\n5. Configure advanced options as needed:\n   - DNS settings (specify DNS servers or use provider's)\n   - MTU optimization (typically 1400-1500)\n   - NAT traversal settings\n\n6.

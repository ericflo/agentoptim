Evaluating customer support responses using AgentOptim v2.0.

This script demonstrates how to use AgentOptim's EvalSet architecture to:
1. Create an EvalSet with quality criteria for support responses
2. Evaluate multiple conversation examples with different response styles
3. Analyze and compare results to identify the best approach
